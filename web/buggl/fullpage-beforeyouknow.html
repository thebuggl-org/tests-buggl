						<h3>Economy</h3>
						<p>Encompassing $363 billion, the Greater Boston metropolitan area has the sixth-largest economy in the 
country and 12th-largest in the world.</p>
						<p>Boston's colleges and universities have a significant effect on the regional economy, with students  
contributing an estimated $4.8 billion annually to the city's economy. Boston's schools are major 
employers and attract industries to the city and surrounding region. Boston is home to a number of 
technology companies and is a hub for biotechnology, with the Milken Institute rating Boston as the top life
 sciences cluster in the country. Boston also receives the highest absolute amount of annual funding from 
the National Institutes of Health of all cities in the United States.</p>

						<h3>Culture</h3>
						<p>Boston shares many cultural roots with greater New England, including a dialect of the non-rhotic Eastern 
New England accent known as Boston English, and a regional cuisine with a large emphasis on seafood, 
salt, and dairy products. Irish Americans are a major influence on Boston's politics and religious 
institutions. Boston also has its own collection of neologisms known as Boston slang.</p>
						<h3>Music</h3>
						<p>The city has a number of ornate theatres, including the Cutler Majestic Theatre, Boston Opera House, Citi 
Performing Arts Center, the Colonial Theater, and the Orpheum Theatre. Renowned performing-arts 
organizations include the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Boston Ballet, Boston Early Music Festival, Boston 
Lyric Opera Company, OperaBoston, Boston Baroque, and the Handel and Haydn Society (one of the 
oldest 1 choral companies in the United States). The city is also a major center for contemporary classical 
music, with a number of performing groups, some of which are associated with the city's conservatories 
and universities. These include Boston Modern Orchestra Project, Boston Musica Viva, Calluthumpian 
Consort, and Dinosaur Annex. There are also many major annual events such as First Night, which occurs 
on New Year's Eve, the annual Boston Arts Festival at Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park, Italian 
summer feasts in the North End honoring Catholic saints, and several events during the Fourth of July 
period. These events include the week-long Harborfest festivities and a Boston Pops concert accompanied 
by fireworks on the banks of the Charles River.</p>
						<h3>History</h3>
						<p>Because of the city's prominent role in the American Revolution, several historic sites relating to that 
period are preserved as part of the Boston National Historical Park. Many are found along the Freedom 
Trail, which is marked by a red line of bricks embedded in the ground. The city is also home to several 
prominent art museums, including the Museum of Fine Arts and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. 
In December 2006, the Institute of Contemporary Art moved from its Back Bay location to a new 
contemporary building designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro located in the Seaport District. The University 
of Massachusetts Boston campus on Columbia Point houses the John F. Kennedy Library. The Boston 
Athenaeum (one of the oldest independent libraries in the United States), Boston Children's Museum, 
Bull & Finch Pub (whose building is known from the television show Cheers), Museum of Science, and the 
New England Aquarium are within the city.</p>
						<h3>Religion</h3>
						<p>Boston has been a noted religious center from its earliest days. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston 
serves nearly 300 parishes and is based in the Cathedral of the Holy Cross (1875) in the South End, while 
the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, with the Cathedral Church of St. Paul (1819) as its episcopal seat, 
serves just under 200 congregations. Two Protestant faiths are headquartered in Boston: Unitarian 
Universalism, with its headquarters on Beacon Hill, and the Christian Scientists, headquartered in Back 
Bay at the Mother Church (1894). The oldest church in Boston is King's Chapel, the city's first Anglican 
church, founded in 1686 and converted to Unitarianism in 1785. Other notable churches include Christ 
Church (better known as Old North Church, 1723), the oldest church building in the city, Trinity Church 
(1733), Park Street Church (1809), First Church in Boston (congregation founded 1630, building raised 
1868), Old South Church (1874), Jubilee Christian Church and Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual 
Help on Mission Hill (1878).</p>

						<h3>Newspaper</h3>
						<p>The Boston Globe and the Boston Herald are two of Boston's major daily newspapers. The city is also 
served by other publications such as The Boston Phoenix, Boston magazine, The Improper Bostonian, 
Boston's Weekly Dig, and the Boston edition of Metro. The Christian Science Monitor, headquartered in 
Boston, was formerly a worldwide daily newspaper but ended publication of daily print editions in 2009, 
switching to continuous online and weekly magazine format publications. The Boston Globe also releases a 
teen publication to the city's public high schools. The newspaper Teens in Print or T.i.P. is written by the 
city's teens and delivered quarterly within the school year.</p>
						<h3>Radio</h3>
						<p>Boston has the largest broadcasting market in New England, with the Boston radio market being the 
eleventh largest in the United States. Several major AM stations include talk radio WRKO 680 AM, 
sports/talk station WEEI 850 AM, and news radio WBZ 1030 AM. A variety of FM radio formats serve the 
area, as do NPR stations WBUR and WGBH. College and university radio stations include WERS 
(Emerson), WHRB (Harvard), WUMB (UMass Boston), WMBR (M.I.T.), WZBC (Boston College), 
WMFO (Tufts University), WBRS (Brandeis University), WTBU (Boston University, campus and 
web only), WRBB (Northeastern University) and WMLN (Curry College).</p>
