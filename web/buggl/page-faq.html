							<h2>Travel Guide Writers:</h2>
							<ul class="faq"> 
								<li>
									<h3>How do I become a Buggl Author?</h3>
									<p>Just start writing your first Buggl travel guide about where you live and what you love.  We will review your work and try to improve it according to our quality standards that we set for all our guidebook authors.  While we don’t expect you to be a professional writer, we do require a few things</p>		
									<ol>
										<li>Unbiased writing – don’t push products or services that aren’t relevant for your travel guide, we will see right through it and so will travelers.</li>	
										<li>Be different and authentic.</li>
										<li>Share you knowledge, you’ll get rewarded.  We always tell our guidebook writers to imagine what they would do if they suddenly became a traveler in their own backyard – how would you travel in your country for the first time?</li>
										<li>Do not copy your content from others.</li>
									</ol>	
												
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>How much should I charge for my travel guide?</h3>
									<p>You can charge anything, but be realistic and fair. This is a marketplace, so the best travel guides will sell no matter what the price. We recommend writing one or two travel guides for free to give the traveler a taste for your knowledge. The following may help you decide how to price your travel guides:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>A range from $0 - $25.  This depends on how much information you’re providing, how many days worth of itineraries and suggestions there are in the guidebook and whom it caters to.</li>

										<li>Are you sharing insider access to a vineyard, helping them get hard to book club or restaurant reservations or anything that’s unique and not offered anywhere else?  It might call for a higher price.</li>
									</ul>	
								</li>  
								<li>
									<h3>How do I get paid?</h3>
									<p>Each time a travel guide is purchased on our platform we pay you directly into PayPal.  We’re working on building out other methods of payment, but for now this is the trusted partner we’ve decided to work with.  For more information on setting up and opening a PayPal account please go to www.paypal.com.  We take 20% on every transaction.  You are responsible for any bank charges incurred in transferring money to your local bank account from your PayPal account.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>What are local references on my profile and why do I need them?</h3>
									<p>You don’t, but the local authors who do will be more trusted.  Your biography on our platform is your local travel resume.  Receiving references will highlight your expertise and background, giving travelers trust in you as a local. You should seek references from people who know you professionally and can vouch for your skills and experience.</p>
								</li>	
								<li>
									<h3>Can I write a travel guide if I run a tour operator or travel agency?</h3>
									<p>Yes, as long as you disclose that you’re a travel agent or tour operator and provide full details about all the places and insider tips you’ve recommended.  Don’t leave information out or only recommend your tour company.  Be honest, people will see right through you and it would be a shame to have you be booted off a great resource for you to meet future clients. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>What if a traveler asks me to meet while they are on their trip?</h3>
									<p>We encourage you to keep in contact professionally with other users by building travel guides and through direct messaging on our platform.  Be respectful and considerate and if there arises a need to communicate outside our platform you’re free to do so, but please use your judgment, as Buggl is not responsible for such communication and interactions.  You may not sell or purchase Travel Guides except for through our platform.</p> 

<p>If there arises an instance where you have insider knowledge that requires a booking, no solicitation of credit card or other information should be asked for over our platform.  Please refer to our Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy for more information.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>How do I get sell more guides? </h3>
									<p>The Buggl Team spends time bringing savvy travelers from all over the world to our platform to discover what you and our other locals are writing about.</p> 

<p>Our success depends on you and how loudly you scream to your networks about what a wonderful platform this is.  We sincerely hope that you will promote your travel guides to your friends and followers on all your social media as well as any personal blogs or travel forums that you contribute to.  Think of this as your side business as well as your passion!</p>

<p>We’re creating a marketplace for quality travel advice so think of us the next time a friend or traveler asks you for advice on what to do.  Don’t just use us to promote your guides, help us by spreading the word to other people around the world who would be great travel guide writers!</p>

							<ul class="faq"> 
								<li>
									<h3>Why buy a travel guide on Buggl?</h3>
									<p>Honestly why wouldn’t you? What are your other options? Guidebooks that are 2 years out of date on print, reviews and blogs from people you don’t know, Travel advice from travel agents who have never been there. At Buggl you are getting freshly updated, locally curated travel information matched to what you are looking for. Give Buggl a go you will not be disappointed.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>How do I contact a travel guide writer?</h3>
									<p>Once logged in as a user, you are able to message other users, including locals and submit custom travel guide requests.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>How do reviews work?</h3>
									<p>We love reviews, but not the ones you see everywhere else. Are reviews are only for customers, not for window shoppers.  If you purchase a travel guide you are able to write a review.  All the reviews shared are from users who have purchased or downloaded the travel guides.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>How is pricing set on Buggl?</h3>
									<p>It’s up to our local guidebook writers how they want to set price. Some of the travel guides are short and only on one day, while others are several days and locations, so price will vary accordingly.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Are Buggl travel guide authors trustworthy?</h3>
									<p>Trust is our main priority for you.  While we can’t look through high tech spy satellites to watch their every move, we have searched the world to bring you local experts who we feel are experts at what they do.  We’ve also included authentic reviews only written by users who buy their guides to decrease fake reviews that are widespread on other sites.  Features like references also allow for you to see other people who have vouched for the local.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>My travel guidebook writer is offering some other cool perks and experiences that I didn’t purchase on Buggl. What should I do?</h3>
									<p>You’re guidebook should include most if not all of what you want, but sometimes there will be additional insider tips that the local can help with outside of our platform.  While you are under no obligation to purchase anything else, nor should you need to in most cases, you might see a local expert who you might want to keep in touch with after purchase.  This decision is up to you, but please use your judgment, as Buggl is not responsible for your communication or interaction with other users of our platform.  Please refer to our Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy for more information.</p>
								</li>	
								<li>
									<h3>I want to meet one of the travel guides writers on my trip, is that safe?</h3>
									<p>Again, we do not monitor what happens on your trip, that part of the responsibility falls onto you.  If you want to connect with a travel guidebook writer outside of our platform you do so at your own responsibility.  We don’t monitor what happens on a trip.</p>
								</li>		
								<li>
									<h3>What if I want a custom experience or a travel guide tailored to my interests?</h3>
