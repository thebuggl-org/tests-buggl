Throughout these Terms of Service "you" or "your" may refer as applicable to the Traveler (as defined below), a Local (as defined below) or a member of the general public accessing or using any of our Services (each a "User"). Please read these Terms of Service carefully, as they may have changed since your last visit. We reserve the right to change these Terms of Service from time to time for any reason, which shall be effected by posting of the updated Terms of Service to our Website; provided that such changes shall only apply to your use of this Website or the Services after the date of such change, unless you expressly accept such changes via a click-through, or signed agreement.  Access to the Website, and use of the Services are subject to these Terms of Service and the Buggl Privacy Policy available on the Website.</p>

<h3>1. Introduction.</h3>

<p>You may be accessing and using the Services as (i) a Traveler, (ii) a Local or (iii) a member of the general public simply using the functionality, and/or reviewing the content, that is publicly available on the Website.  Buggl hereby grants to you, subject to the Terms of Service set forth herein, a nontransferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, limited right to access and use the Services solely for the uses provided for herein and subject to the policies and restrictions that we post on our Website from time to time. Certain of our Services are reserved for registered Users.</p>

<p>The Services include an online e-marketplace for connecting Users who seek travel information (such User, a "Traveler") about a destination(s) from Users with locale-specific travel information or suggestions (such User, a "Local") and who make such information available in a travel guide (each a "Travel Guide") that may be purchased  through our Services.  The Services can be used to facilitate the listing and purchasing of Travel Guides.  Listings of the Travel Guides are viewable and searchable through the Services.  A Travel Guide may include written materials, photos, maps and other travel media as created by the Local.  As independent contractors, the Locals listed on our Services choose the topic and content of their Travel Guide. A Local may submit a Travel Guide for posting on the Services by submitting a listing ("Listing") consistent with the policies set forth by Buggl on the Website from time to time.  The Services may enable Travelers to post ratings and reviews regarding particular Travel Guides or Locals (each, a "Review")  in Public Areas (as defined below) on the Service from time to time. You 
are responsible for selecting the right Travel Guide for your needs. 

<h3>2. Scope of Service.</h3>

<p>You are responsible for obtaining any equipment and Internet service necessary to accessing our Services and for paying any fees for the equipment and service you select.  We may alter, suspend, or discontinue this Website or the Services in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, without notice.  The Services may also periodically become unavailable due to maintenance or malfunction of computer equipment or for other reasons. We may provide access to third party services and products from time to time or to our own products or services. You acknowledge that the Website and any mobile applications are evolving and that the form and nature of the Website or mobile applications, including the Services, may change from time to time without notice to you.</p>

<p>If you are using the Services in your capacity as an employee, you must have the ability to bind your employer by your use of the Services.</p>

<h3>3. Buggl is Only a Platform.</h3>

<p>THE SERVICES INCLUDE A PLATFORM FOR TRAVELERS TO FIND TRAVEL GUIDES WRITTEN BY LOCALS FOR VARIOUS DESTINATIONS, ACTIVITIES AND OTHER TOPICS. BUGGL DOES NOT TAKE PART IN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TRAVELERS AND LOCALS OTHER THAN PROVIDING THE PLATFORM FOR TRAVELERS TO FIND AND PURCHASE TRAVEL GUIDES PROVIDED BY LOCALS.  BUGGL MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE LEGALITY, SUITABILITY, APPROPRIATENESS, OR ACCURACY OF THE TRAVEL GUIDES OR CONTENT REQUESTED OR PROVIDED BY USERS THROUGH THE SERVICES. BUGGL DOES NOT MONITOR OR CONTROL TRAVEL GUIDES, ANY REVIEWS PROVIDED BY USERS, OR ANY OF THE ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS WHATSOEVER OF ANY USER. BUGGL CANNOT CONFIRM THAT EACH USER IS WHO THEY CLAIM TO BE, THOUGH BUGGL MAY CONDUCT BACKGROUND CHECKS ON LOCALS FROM TIME TO TIME.</p>

<p>BEFORE PURCHASING A TRAVEL GUIDE, YOU SHOULD REVIEW AND INVESTIGATE EACH LOCAL'S PROFILE AND SELF-REPORTED CREDENTIALS, AS WELL AS REVIEWS FROM OTHER USERS REGARDING THE LOCAL AND THE APPLICABLE TRAVEL GUIDE. WHILE WE USE GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO CONFIRM THAT EACH LOCAL ON OUR WEBSITE IS WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES REGARDING THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF LOCALS AND THE INFORMATION THEY PROVIDE VIA OUR SERVICES.  BUGGL DOES NOT RECOMMEND OR ENDORSE ANY PARTICULAR LOCAL. BUGGL DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES 
REGARDING ANY LOCAL'S PROFESSIONAL ACCREDITATION, REGISTRATION OR LICENSE. WHEN INTERACTING WITH OTHER USERS YOU SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION AND COMMON SENSE TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL SAFETY AND PROPERTY, JUST AS YOU WOULD WHEN INTERACTING WITH OTHER PERSONS WHOM YOU DON'T KNOW.  NEITHER BUGGL NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICE.  BUGGL AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.</p>

<p>BY ENABLING USERS TO PURCHASE TRAVEL GUIDES FROM OUR SERVICES THAT MAY CONTAIN INFORMATION REGARDING TRAVEL TO CERTAIN DESTINATIONS (ESPECIALLY INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS), OR ABOUT CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, BUGGL DOES NOT ENDORSE, REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS, OR ENGAGING IN SUCH ACTIVITIES IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK; BUGGL IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM USER'S RELIANCE ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR USER'S TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS OR USER'S ENGAGING IN SUCH ACTIVITIES.</p>

<h3>4. Disputes; Release.</h3>

<p>Buggl expressly disclaims any liability or claims that may arise between Users of our Services. You are solely responsible for your interactions with all other Users and any disputes that arise from those interactions with other Users.  Buggl may monitor disputes between Users, but is not obligated to monitor, mediate, or resolve such disputes.</p>

<p>Because Buggl is not responsible for or involved in any contact between Travelers and Locals or in the assessment or provision of Travel Guides, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more Users, you hereby release Buggl (and our officers, directors, agents, investors, subsidiaries, and employees) from any and all claims, demands, or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind, known and unknown arising out of or in any way related with such disputes.</p>

<p>If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</p>

<h3>5. Transactions and Our Fees.</h3>
