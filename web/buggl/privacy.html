The Services can be used to facilitate the listing and purchasing of Travel Guides. Listings of the Travel Guides are viewable and searchable through the Services. A Travel Guide may include written materials, photos, maps and other travel media as created by the Local.

A Local may submit a Travel Guide for posting on the Services by submitting a listing ("Listing") consistent with the policies set forth by Buggl on the Website from time to time. The Services may enable Travelers to post ratings and reviews regarding particular Travel Guides or Locals (each, a "Review") in Public Areas (as defined in the Terms of Service) on the Service from time to time.</p>

"Personal Information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, or e-mail address, etc.) or other information about that individual that is directly linked to Personal Information.

We use Personal Information to deliver the Services to you, to improve the delivery of our Services, including advertising, and to develop analytics and aggregated data that allow us and our partners to improve our Services and correspond with you.</p>
<p>We also collect and store non-personally identifiable information that is automatically generated when you use the Services. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. By using our Services, you indicate your consent for Buggl and our affiliates to send cookies to your computer in order to uniquely identify your browser and improve the quality of our services; you may turn off cookies in your browser though, in doing so, some or all of our Services may not work. A "cookie" is a piece of alphanumeric data stored on a visitor's hard drive that enables us to improve your access to our Website and identify repeat visitors to our Services. We use the non-personally identifiable information, such as your browser version, IP address, referring domains, pages visited, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, the nature of your use of the Website and cookie information, to improve our Website delivery, including advertising, and to develop analytics and aggregated data that allow us and our partners to utilize our Service and reach out to you via our Services or otherwise. If you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by Buggl, or by any other website, you can do this through your browser settings. The Help function within your browser should tell you how to do so. For information on how to delete cookies on the browser of your mobile phone as applicable you will need to refer to your handset manual.</p>
<p>We also collect Reviews from users. Those Reviews may be broadly disseminated by the Services and its users, and are not subject to any limitations on use or disclosure by Buggl.</p>
<p>In general, our collection and use of information is as follows:</p>
<ul class="spa">
<li>
<p>Buggl collects Personal Information you knowingly choose to submit to us during registration, such as your name, and email address, which we use for the following general purposes: identification and authentication of a user, improvement to the Services, contact, research, and reporting of aggregated, anonymous data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buggl automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookies, and the pages you request. IP addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. Your IP address is stored by Buggl when you register with Buggl. IP addresses may be used for various research purposes, and/or delivering unique functionality to our service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buggl may make discussion boards, forums and chat rooms (Public Areas) available to you on our Services. You participate in these Public Areas with the acknowledgement that any information you share will be available to other users, including any Personal Information that you share in Public Areas. We may allow users to post content on the Services. If we make such a feature available, you post content at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you choose to share your information. Even after removal, copies of such content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Log Files</h2>
<p>Like many websites, we may automatically gather certain information about our Website traffic and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Website, to track users' movements around the Website and to gather demographic information about our user base. We may link this automatically collected data to Personal Information. IP addresses may be tied to Personal Information to troubleshoot access issues and ban users by IP from certain communities upon appropriate request.</p>
<p>We may use a third-party tracking service that uses log files and cookies, see below, to track non-Personal Information about visitors to the Website in the aggregate. This service captures usage and volume statistics as well as geographical location data to compile usage reports and maps for optimization and troubleshooting purposes.</p>
<h2>Clear Gifs(Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h2>
<p>We may employ, and our third party advertising partners may employ, a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as web beacons or web bugs, that help manage content on the Site by tracking what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
